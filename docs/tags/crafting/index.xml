      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;hero&#34; src=&#34;https://unbounded.school/images/hero/habitat.jpg&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;A diorama is like a tiny world you build to show a scene, like a forest, desert, or even a superhero hideout! It’s a small model made on a base, like a piece of cardboard, where you add things like grass, rocks, trees, or buildings to make it look real. Think of it as a 3D picture you can touch, kind of like a toy set or a scene from a movie, but you make it yourself with crafts! It’s fun because you get to create every part of your little world.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
