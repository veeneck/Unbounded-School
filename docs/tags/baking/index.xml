      <description>&lt;img class=&#34;hero&#34; src=&#34;http://localhost:1313/images/hero/cookies.jpg&#34; /&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hi there, young baker! Baking is like magic—you mix simple things and turn them into yummy treats. This lesson is all about making egg-free cookies (maybe chocolate chip or something fun like that!), a super easy recipe that’s perfect for beginners. You’ll do most of it yourself, but remember: Always have a grown-up nearby for safety, especially with the oven.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;find-a-recipe-online&#34;&gt;Find a Recipe Online&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Baking starts with a good plan! Recipes are like treasure maps that tell you exactly what to do. Today, we’re making egg-free cookies because they’re yummy and safe for everyone—even if someone can’t eat eggs. You get to pick your own recipe this time!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
