I trained for a one-mile race once. Every Wednesday, I would practice. 

- On the first Wednesday of practice, I ran two minutes and walked one minute five times.
- On the second Wednesday, I ran three minutes and walked one minute four times.
- On the third Wednesday, I ran five minutes and walked one minute two times.
- The fourth Wednesday I ran a whole mile without stopping to walk.

I ran with some of my neighbors from Crocker Court, so we made shirts that
said Crocker Cruisers. It was a blast!

On the race day there was so many fun things! There were big tractors you got to go
in and lots of candy. When the race was about to start, we lined up at the starting line.
To save our energy, we didn’t start running as fast as we could when they said, “Go!”
Instead, we started off jogging. We didn’t stop to walk, we kept on going. Even though we didn’t 
win, everyone got little gift bags. The Crocker Cruisers got the time of eight minutes and 
fifteen seconds. We had so much fun!
