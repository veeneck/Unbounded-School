   In the book Holes there is a boy named Stanley.  He went to school and was a
pretty big kid, and he got laughed at for that. One day, he was walking under a
bridge on his way home from school and from out of the top of the bridge, shoes fell down on
him. They were a famous baseball players shoes. The cops came by and took him
to court. They gave him the choice to go to jail or Camp Green Lake. He chose Camp
Green Lake.

   He took a hot, sweaty 8 hour bus ride to the camp. When Stanley looked out the window
there was no lake, just rock hard dirt. It turns out that there used to be a lake there, but it
was so hot that it dried up. They went into a small building with a man in a big desk eating
sunflower seeds. He said “I’m Mr. Sir”, gave Stanley two pairs of clothes and a hat then said
“One pair is for working and the other is for relaxing”. He stood up and said “This is no girl
scouts club”. Then he took him to a guy named Mr. Pendanski.   

   Mr. Sir left and Mr. Pendanski showed Stanley to the other boys that would be in his tent.
There was Zigzag, Armpit, Squid, X-ray, Magnet, and Zero. Those weren’t their real names,
it was just what they wanted to be called. Soon, it was time for dinner. The food was interesting,
but Stanley didn’t mind. Stanley got a cold four minute shower. Then they went to bed because
they had to wake up at 4:30 in the morning so they got to dig in the cooler time of the day.

   The next morning they ate breakfast and went to dig. The ground was rock hard and he was supposed
to dig five feet deep and five feet wide. The water came here and there and gave them water. He was last 
to finish his hole. When he finished, he went to the rec room which is where the boys hang out. In there is 
where he got his nickname, Caveman. He went to the tent and wrote a letter to his mom, and went to go 
eat dinner.

   After dinner he took a shower and went to bed. It was a couple days until he heard back, but when he 
did he read the letter. As he read Zero came over and looked over Stanley’s shoulder. He didn’t know how 
to read or write so he asked Stanley to teach him but Stanley was too tired to. He told Stanley that he
 would dig a hour of his hole every day if Stanley taught him to read and write. It was a deal. A few days 
later the other boys got jealous and called Zero Stanley’s slave. At lunchtime they were messing around 
with Stanley and told him they would give him their cookie if he would let him dig his hole. It became a 
fight and then Zero came in and choked a boy, Mr. Pendanski stopped them but then Zero hit Mr. 
Pendanski with a shovel and ran away. After two days, Stanley went out to look for Zero. He found him 
under a little boat. Stanley thought they should go back but Zero didn’t want to. So they kept going.

   There was a cliff they had to climb and big hills but they still kept going. They finally made it to a dirty 
puddle of water and then Stanley pulled a weed looking like thing, it was an onion!

   They decided to pick some onions and go back to camp to get something the leader of the camp 
wants - the Warden and it is buried under ground. They walked and walked until they got back to the
camp. Zero went and stole some food while Stanley started digging. When they found what they were
looking for, the Warden, Mr. Sir, and Mr. Pendanski came. Then a bunch of yellow spotted lizards started
crawling on Stanley and Zero. For a while nothing happened and then a lawyer for Stanley came and
somehow Stanley and Zero got out safely. Stanley’s name was on the treasure so he got to keep it. Before
he left he said that he couldn’t leave with out Zero so Zero got to come and right before they hopped in
the car, all the other boys came out surprised that they were still alive and they said goodbye.

When they got home, Stanley’s dad had finished an invention. Then Stanley opened the treasure up, 
there was money! After that, they had a little party.
