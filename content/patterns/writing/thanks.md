Dear Mimi and Paddy,

   Thank you so much for letting us stay with you on the other half of our vacation. I loved
sleeping in those comfy beds you setup for us. Every night I slept like a baby. Looking for 
golf balls in your backyard was so much fun. You had so many colorful ones! The food you
 made us was delicious, especially the tater tots. The presents you got us were awesome! I 
can’t wait till it rains so I can wear my new purple rain boots! Staying with you was so much
fun! I had an amazing time! 

   I can’t wait till I see you next time!
Love, Scarlett
