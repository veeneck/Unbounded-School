A diorama is like a tiny world you build to show a scene, like a forest, desert, or even a superhero hideout! It’s a small model made on a base, like a piece of cardboard, where you add things like grass, rocks, trees, or buildings to make it look real. Think of it as a 3D picture you can touch, kind of like a toy set or a scene from a movie, but you make it yourself with crafts! It’s fun because you get to create every part of your little world.

## Pick Your Habitat

Hey, habitat hero! Choose a cool place for your scene—like a jungle, desert, or swamp. Use what you’ve learned about continents or ask Grok or Google for ideas!

Grab a cardboard box to build your scene in. Ready? Let’s go!

## Plan Your Scene

Think about these fun details:

1. What’s the backdrop painting on the far wall?
2. What’s the ground like—grass, dirt, or water?
3. Any buildings or structures, like a bridge?
4. Are there animals chilling in your scene?

Check this video for inspiration:

Now, grab paper the same size as your box’s base. Sketch where stuff like grass, rivers, or rocks will go. Where will trees or animals hang out—on a rock or in a tree?

## How to Build It

Plan how to craft your scene! For example, watch this for bush-making tips:

Ask Grok or Google for help, like:
- How do I make a cardboard tree?
- How can my river look super real?

Start building:
1. Paint the backdrop first—it’s tricky to reach later.
2. Add the ground layer next while it’s easy to work on.
3. Build structures separately, then glue them in.

## Show It Off!

Snap a pic or record a video tour of your awesome scene. Share it online or show it off in person—you’re a star creator!
