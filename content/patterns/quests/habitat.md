A diorama is like a tiny world you build to show a scene, like a forest, desert, or even a superhero hideout! It’s a small model made on a base, like a piece of cardboard, where you add things like grass, rocks, trees, or buildings to make it look real. Think of it as a 3D picture you can touch, kind of like a toy set or a scene from a movie, but you make it yourself with crafts! It’s fun because you get to create every part of your little world.

## Pick and Plan Your Scene

Today is all about finding the habitat you would like to create. You've been learning about continents and habitats, so feel free to use that knowledge. You can also search Grok or Google for ideas like rivers, swamps, tropics or deserts.

Once you have thought of your habitat, your next step is to think about building supplies:

1. Find or create a cardboard box for your scene!

## Arranging Your Scene

1. What will the backdrop painting of the far wall of your scene be?
2. What will the ground look like?
3. What sort of building or structure (i.e: bridge) will be in the scene?
4. Are any animals in the scene?

You can watch this video for ideas:

Once you have your answers, it is time for layout!

1. Take a sheet of paper, and cut it to the same dimensiosn as the ground of your scene.

2. Next, with pencil, layout where different materials are on your gorund layer. Think about grass, rivers, ponds, gravel, dirt and so on.

While you're doing this, also try and think about where trees and animals will go. Are they sitting on a large rock, or hanging from a tree?

## How Will You Build It?

Take note of everything in your scene, and start to think about how you will craft it. For example, if you had small bushes, the following tip may work:

You can use Grok or Google to ask for tips on other parts of your scene like:

- How can I use cardboard to craft a tree?
- How can I make a river look real in my diorama?

## Gather Supplies & Build

Gather all of the crafting paper, cardboard, glue and other supplies you'll need.

If you need to purchase something like flock for grass, or small plastic animals, find them on Amazon and let us know!

Once you have everything, start crafting with these tips in mind:

1. Start with your backdrop, as it will be hard to reach it once you start building in front of it.
2. The ground layer is easiest to do next while you can reach it.
3. Buildings or structures can be built on their own, and then later glued into the scene.

## Show It Off!

Take a picture or give a video tour of your scene. Then send it around digitally, or show of your diorama in person!
