## A Trip to The Zoo

While there, see if any of the animals on your list can be seen there. If so, record yourself talking to the camera explaining what you have learned about the animal.

## Video Presentation

Now that you have your information and video clips of your zoo presentations, you're going to edit a video. To do this, make sure you have:

1. An intro video clip of you explaining what the video will be about.
2. A clip of you talking about each of your 8 animals.
3. For animals that you could not find at the zoo, find a picture of them to use.
4. A exit clip of you summarzing your video and ending it.

Once you have everything together, you're ready to open Final Cut Pro and make your video.

For this step, Dad will walk you through getting started.
