## What is Anime?

While the music and culture of KPOP Demon Hunters are amazing, the drawing and animation bring it to life.

Anime can have many different definitions and sub categories. Americans may say art is only Anime if it is made in Japan. Japanese may say all animation is anime. Then, there are subtle details, like lower frame rates that may make someone consider an animation to be anime.

Since KPop Demon Hunters is an American made film, it may not fall under the anime category. What do you think?

Give it a shot: let's try drawing some eyes!
