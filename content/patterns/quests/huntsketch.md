Hey explorer! Use Apple Maps, Grok, or Google to answer these cool questions:

1. What's the capital of South Korea?
2. Could you walk to South Korea from Kansas? What about sailing there by boat?
3. How many miles from Kansas to South Korea's capital?
4. How long to fly that adventure?
5. What's South Korea's time zone? Kansas's? If it's 3 PM in Kansas, what's the time in South Korea?
