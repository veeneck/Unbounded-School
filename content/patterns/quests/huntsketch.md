Using Apple Maps, Grok & Google, see if you can answer the following questions:

1. What is the capital of South Korea?
2. Can you walk to South Korea from Kansas? How about getting there by boat? 
3. How many miles is it from Kansas to the capital South Korea?
4. How long would it take you to fly that trip?
5. What timezone is South Korea in? How about Kansas? If it is 3pm in Kansas, what time is it in South Korea?

Give it a shot: let's try drawing some eyes!

## What is Anime?

While the music and culture of KPOP Demon Hunters are amazing, the drawing and animation bring it to life.

Anime can have many different definitions and sub categories. Americans may say art is only Anime if it is made in Japan. Japanese may say all animation is anime.

Sometimes subtle details, like lower frame rates, may make someone consider an animation to be anime.

Since KPop Demon Hunters is an American made film, it may not fall under the anime category. Write down what you think.
