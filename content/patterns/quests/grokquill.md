## Daily Writing

First, write in your daily journal. This can be your book report, Socratic discussion, or other daily writing tasks.

After watching the video above, see if you can include one of the 6 tips in your writing.

## Grading By Grok

The second step of your writing quest is to practice typing. Type up your previous entry to get some practice.

Then, go to Grok, and start with an introduction along the lines of:

<pre>I am a 9 year old 4th grader, and I'd like you to grade 
my writing as if you were my teacher.</pre>

Once Grok asks for your writing, **copy and paste** what you typed to get your grade.

Make note of your grade, and read Grok's suggestions on how you could do better.

## Type Revision

Using the feedback from Grok, revise your typed file with improvements and email it to us. You can also ask Grok to grade it again to see if you have improved.
