## Daily Writing

Write in your daily journal. This can be your book report, Socratic discussion, or other daily writing tasks.

## Grading By Grok

Type up your previous writing to practice your typing skills.

Go to grok, and start with an introduction along the lines of:

"I am a 9 year old 4th grader, and I'd like you to grade my writing as if you were my teacher."

Once Grok asks for your writing, copy and paste what you typed to get your grade.

Make note of your grade, and also ask follow up questions to Grok like:

"How could I do better?" Save the results.

## Type Revision

Using the feedback from Grok, revise your typed file with improvements and email it to us.
