Get ready for an awesome adventure to become a super stretcher and a 5K running champ! You'll learn fun stretches, make a training schedule, and train to run 3.1 miles with a big smile.

## Making a Training Plan

Open up Grok and introduce yourself. Grok will help you create a plan tailored specifically to you. To start the discussion, type in:

<pre>I'm a 9 year old girl and I'd like help creating a 5k training plan. 
I'm starting today, and my race is on October 18th. 
Let me tell you a bit about myself before you create the plan.</pre>

After the introduction, Grok will want to know 2 things:

1. **X**: How many days a week you can train for. Since you already play soccer, you only have to train for the race **1** to **2** days per week.
2. **Y**: How many days you are currently exercising. You currently have **4** soccer practices.

See if you can come up with a summary to share with Grok. An example would be:

<pre>I currently play soccer on: Monday, Tuesday, Thursday & Saturday. 
I would like add run training 1 more day on Wednesdays.</pre>

Grok will give you a suggested training schedule!

## Calender-ing

After talking with Grok, you probably have a rough schedule in mind. **Let's add it to a calendar**.

You can either:
1. Add it to the digital calendar on your iPad in the calendar app.
2. Write your training down on a physical calendar.

Discuss the pros and cons of each with a parent, and then make your decision. This is also a good time to review your proposed schedule with them.

This step is important -- it will hold you accountable!

## Super Stretches
Stretching makes you flexible like a ninja! Do a 3-minute stretch before running and a 5-minute stretch after. Check out these cool stretches: [have a look at these basic stretches](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/in-depth/stretching/art-20546848)! Watch this video for more:

Pick your favorites and **write down** a strech plan that you can stick to!

## Train!
Follow your running schedule and have fun! Remember to:
1. Drink water and stretch before you run.
2. Run at your own pace and follow your plan.
3. Do cooldown stretches after.
4. Log your runs on your Apple Watch.

Write down how you feel or take photos to show your adventure!

## Race Day
It’s time to shine! You’ve trained for 4 weeks, and now it’s your 5K! Ask a grown-up to take photos or videos, or do it yourself! This is your first 5k, so capture the memories!
