## Math & Logic

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the primary math curriculum. After completing grade-level material, supplement with [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com). Once mastered, advance to the next grade on a limited basis, reducing math to 2–3 days weekly to prioritize Logic, Technology, and Science. For example, replace some math with [Learning to Code](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/).

## Social Studies

Use [BrainPop](https://www.brainpop.com) for Social Studies, alternating daily with physical workbooks from the 180 Days series: [Geography](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071750.html), [Social Studies](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071764.html), [Science](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071757.html). Rotate weekly between Geography, Biology, and History unless focusing on a specific project.

## Sciences

Science is currently integrated into Social Studies resources. Supplement with field trips for Health and Technology topics.

## Reading and Language

Use [Lexia](https://www.lexialearning.com) as the primary tool. After completing grade-level material, supplement with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Incorporate **DEAR** (Drop Everything & Read) and the [Grok & Quill](/patterns/quests/grokquill/) daily writing quest. Conduct weekly spelling tests based on ongoing tasks.

## Projects

Self-guided projects allow deep exploration after core tasks are complete. These multi-step tasks can include non-traditional subjects like music, art, dance, or theater, either self-directed or through electives like singing or Monart drawing.

## Music & PE

On non-sport practice days, hold joint PE sessions with neighbors, rotating between in-season and off-season sports or seasonal activities like rollerblading or training for a local 5k. On sport practice days (2 days/week), schedule music activities like guitar, singing, songwriting, or choreography. Additional options include swimming, yoga, climbing, or pickleball at the YMCA.

## Project Days

When weekly core tasks are complete, dedicate time to projects. With Math and Language removed, gain ~2 hours 15 minutes for projects. Prep Monday–Thursday during project slots, with crafting or assembly on Friday.

## Testing

We use the [NWEA MAP Growth](https://www.nwea.org/map-growth/) test through Homeschool Boss. It is a computer-adaptive, standardized assessment designed to measure student achievement and academic growth in core subjects like Math, Reading, Language Usage, and Science. It adjusts question difficulty based on a student's responses, providing a precise evaluation of their skills across K–12 levels. Primarily used by schools but adapted for homeschoolers, it offers detailed, immediate reports with percentile rankings and growth projections aligned with Common Core standards. The untimed, flexible format allows students to test at home, making it ideal for personalized learning environments.
