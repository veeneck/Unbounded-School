## Math & Logic

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the primary math curriculum. After completing grade-level material, supplement with [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com). Once mastered, advance to the next grade on a limited basis, reducing math to 2–3 days weekly to prioritize Logic, Technology, and Science. For example, replace some math with [Learning to Code](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/).

## Social Studies

Use [BrainPop](https://www.brainpop.com) for Social Studies, alternating daily with physical workbooks from the 180 Days series: [Geography](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071750.html), [Social Studies](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071764.html), [Science](https://www.rainbowresource.com/071757.html). Rotate weekly between Geography, Biology, and History unless focusing on a specific project.

## Sciences

Science is currently integrated into Social Studies resources. Supplement with field trips for Health and Technology topics.

## Reading and Language

Use [Lexia](https://www.lexialearning.com) as the primary tool. After completing grade-level material, supplement with [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/). Incorporate **DEAR** (Drop Everything & Read) and the [Grok & Quill](/patterns/quests/grokquill/) daily writing quest. Conduct weekly spelling tests based on ongoing tasks.

## Projects

Self-guided projects allow deep exploration after core tasks are complete. These multi-step tasks can include non-traditional subjects like music, art, dance, or theater, either self-directed or through electives like singing or Monart drawing.

Future project ideas: programming, Photoshop, camping, architecture, sewing, baking, finance, drawing, singing, theater, photography, story writing, business.

## Music & PE

On non-sport practice days, hold joint PE sessions with neighbors, rotating between in-season and off-season sports or seasonal activities like rollerblading or training for a local 5k. On sport practice days (2 days/week), schedule music activities like guitar, singing, songwriting, or choreography. Additional options include swimming, yoga, climbing, or pickleball at the YMCA.

## Project Days

When weekly core tasks are complete, dedicate time to projects. With Math and Language removed, gain ~2 hours 15 minutes for projects. Prep Monday–Thursday during project slots, with crafting or assembly on Friday.

## Testing

Standardized testing TBD. Options under consideration:
- [IOWA Testing](https://www.setontesting.com/product/iowa-assessments-form-e/): ~$47, mail-in grading
- [Homeschool Boss](https://homeschoolboss.com/pricing/#yearly): $60 one-time or $160 for 3x, remote administration
- [ERB Testing](https://www.erblearn.org/families/isee-registration/): ~$185, remote administration
