## Math & Logic

[Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) is the primary math curriculum. Once grade level is completed, [Beast Academy](https://beastacademy.com) will be used to supplement. Once grade level is mastered, math will be advanced to the next grade on a limited basis. Math studies will be reduced to 2 or 3 days a week, while Logic, Technology and Science take priority. As an example, [Learning to Code](https://developer.apple.com/swift-playground/) would be a suitable replacement.

## Social Studies

[BrainPop](https://www.brainpop.com) is the digital tool used for Social Studies. For variety, physicial workbooks are used as well. Try to rotate between digital and physical methods each day. Additionally, mix in different studies (Geography, Biology, History) on a weekly basis unless there is a specific project focus that week.

## Sciences

For now, Science is covered in most of our Social Studies resources. Field trips will be mixed in to cover certain areas like Health & Technology.

## Reading and Language

[Lexia](https://www.lexialearning.com) is the main tool in use. Once grade levels are complete, [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/) will be used to supplement additional material. **DEAR** (Drop Everything & Read) along with the [Grok & Quill](/patterns/quests/grokquill/) daily writing quest also improve this area.

## Projects

Projects are self guided tasks that can take up long chunks of time. Once core tasks are completed, there is enough time to dig deep into a project. 

Future project ideas: programming; photoshop; camping; architecture; sewing; baking; finance;

## PE

On days when there is no sport practice outside of school, PE will be a joint session with the neighbors. We rotate between the sport in season and the out of season sports. Seasonal activities like roller blading are planned around the yearly events.

## Project Days

Once all core tasks are completed for a week, that time can be spent entirely on projects. With Math & Language gone, an extra 2 hours and 15 minutes is free to work on various projects.

## Testing

TBD on which standardized test. IOWA test or various homeschool tests.
