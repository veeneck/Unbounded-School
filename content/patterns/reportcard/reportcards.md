## Key Achievements

In Math, she has completed more than 50% of the curriculum with 100% mastery. In Lexia, she passed Core 16 with a 95% score and Core 17 with a perfect 100%.

She demonstrates thoroughness in her Social Studies, Science, and Spelling workbooks, rarely missing any problems. Her reading and comprehension skills are steadily improving, as reflected in her thoughtful book reports on [Holes](/patterns/writing/holes/) and [100 Dresses](/patterns/writing/100dresses/).

In PE and extracurricular activities (Monart & Soccer), Scarlett excels with outstanding effort and a positive attitude, contributing to her well-rounded development.

## Areas For Growth

Scarlett's writing shows consistent improvement, building on her solid work in [$1,000,000](/patterns/writing/million/) and [My Superpower](/patterns/writing/superhero/). To improve depth, she can incorporate more descriptive adjectives, vary phrasing to minimize repetition, and revise drafts to refine sentence structure.

In Music, Scarlett demonstrates strong efforts despite limited practice time. Continuing to build skills by mastering additional songs on the recorder or completing a track in GarageBand will further develop her abilities.
