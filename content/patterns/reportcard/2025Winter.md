## Key Achievements

Scarlett demonstrated strong mastery of core topics this semester. She fully completed the Khan Academy 4th Grade math curriculum and transitioned to Beast Academy Level 4, earning a 100% on the Khan Academy end-of-year assessment and a MAP Math score of 243 (99th percentile). In Lexia, she completed Level 18 with 98% accuracy and has advanced to Khan Academy 4th Grade Reading units.

Her enthusiasm for independent reading and writing remains evident. She finished Seaside Sanctuary, Charlotte's Web, and Where the Red Fern Grows, with particularly strong comprehension and reflection shown in her [book report on the latter](/patterns/writing/redfern/). She also began typing practice on EdClub and completed a combined writing/fitness project documenting her [1 mile fun run](/patterns/writing/1mile/).

## Areas For Growth

Scarlett’s passion for art and creative expression grew noticeably this semester, highlighted by her ongoing Dinosaur project and her first full attempt at writing, directing, and editing an original script into a finished short film. With a packed schedule, there has been less time for music, dance, and singing. This is to be expected with a flexible schedule. When curiosity strike, it is important for Scarlett to deep dive on it. Moving forward, more time can be dedicated to a project that incorporates music. For example, the film mentioned above could be edited to add a soundtrack, or sound effects.
